# evt2sigma
Log Entry to Sigma Rule Converter

# What it does

It takes a log entry from a file and tries to create a [Sigma](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma) rule. It is optimized for the XML format of Windows EVTX event logs but can be easily modified to support more log formats by adding a new regular expression for the respective log type. 

# Status

The current state is "alpha". It's more like a public POC so that others can learn and extend. 

# Usage

    usage: evt2sigma.py [-h] [-f file] [-o out-file] [-fc field-count] [--debug]
                        [--trace] [-a] [-r] [-l] [-t] [-d] [-p] [-s] [-c]
